PracticeBioAppAngular

Run NPM install

Then run: npm install typescript@2.8 --save-dev

Then run: 'ng serve --open' to start the app in the browser.

This is just an app I am using to hammer in the basics and fundamentals of Angular for myself. At the same time, this app is informative and useful and will probably be continually updated.

Note to self: to pull from master copy and paste: git pull https://github.com/cbc5y/PracticeBioAppAngular.git master
