PracticeBioAppAngular

Run NPM install

Then run: npm install typescript@2.8 --save-dev

Then run: 'ng serve --open' to start the app in the browser.

This is just an app I am using to hammer in the basics and fundamentals of Angular for myself. At the same time, this app is informative and useful and will probably be continually updated.
